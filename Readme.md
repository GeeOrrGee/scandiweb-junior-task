Hello!

This is the Scandiweb's React Junior Developer task. In this project I learned how to interact with GraphQL Endpoint with ApolloClient,
whilst using React's class components, which , also was a big challenge and experience for me to do so (just because I wasn't using Class Components heavily in the past,
but I got the hang of it in short amount of time). Overall this project truly gave me the real life development-like experience of React Developer and from now on, I'm
looking forward to work on greater projects with even more challenges!

Used Technologies:
-React.JS (Class Components)
-CSS-in-JS , styled components (with SCSS syntax)
-React's Context-API
-GraphQL and ApolloClient (Query Fetching, loading state and etc.)

Currently learning/working on:
-Next.js
-Redux
